# Annex

Annex is a simple appstore for [GNOME Shell Extensions](gnome-shell-extensions).

## Status

This is not a serious project, meaning:

* It's just for fun
* There are no releases or builds
* It will not become an official GNOME application

If you choose to distribute or run this program, you are on your own. Unless
you make money, in which case you owe me.
